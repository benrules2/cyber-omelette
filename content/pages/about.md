title: About Me

Hey, I'm Ben Eagan.

I'm a maker, tinkerer, and software engineer based in Toronto. By day, I work in Search and Retrieval and Natural Language Understanding; I started out in High Performance Computing before making that shift about a decade ago.

This blog is where I document my DIY projects and experiments: the stuff I build for fun, curiosity, or because I couldn't find one to buy. There's something satisfying about watching LEDs blink and seeing code actually move physical things.

## What I Make

My projects tend to fall into a few categories:

**Smart Home & Voice Assistants:** I've built Alexa-powered devices including a [Big Mouth Billy Bass](/posts/billy-bass-alexa.html) that talks back, and various Raspberry Pi integrations that let voice commands control things around the house.

**Raspberry Pi Projects:** From [smart mirrors](/posts/smart-mirror.html) to home servers, I love what you can do with a $35 computer. My Magic Mirror build got some attention when it hit Reddit's front page.

**Coffee Nerdery:** I roast my own beans using a modified hot air popcorn popper and pull shots on a Gaggia Classic Pro that I've repaired and tweaked over the years.

**Astrophotography:** After seeing incredible photos of the Milky Way, I built my own [barn door tracker](/posts/manual-barn-door-tracker.html) for under $50 to take long-exposure shots without star trails.

**Vision Tech:** One project I'm proud of is [The All-Seeing Pi](/posts/all-seeing-pi.html), a vision enhancement platform I built with my friend Dan, who is blind. It's a wearable video system designed to maximize limited sight.

## Why "Cyber Omelette"?

You've got to break a few eggs to make an omelette, and that's basically how I build things. Trial and error, broken parts, learning as I go. And like an omelette, this blog is just a mix of whatever ingredients I'm working with at the moment: code, hardware, woodworking, coffee, whatever.
