After working on [the All-Seeing Pi](http://www.cyber-omelette.com/2017/03/all-seeing-pi.html), a series of events unfolded such that Dan and I were put in contact with a company called [eSight](https://www.esighteyewear.com/). The founder of eSight had the same inspiration as the All-Seeing Pi many years ago, and has now developed the third generation of a vision assist platform.  
  
So we were invited to come check out their technology, and see how it stacks up to our contraption. For starters, it is a very sleek and lightweight design that looks a little more stylish. It also has some great vision enhancement functionality like contrast boosting, magnification, and screenshots. Using these features, Dan was able to read an eye chart at the "20-30" level, which is better than he was able to see before he lost his vision!  
  
This hasn't stopped our interest in the All-Seeing Pi though, as eSight comes with a pretty hefty price tag of $10k. An existing commercial solution is never a good reason to stop a DIY project too!
