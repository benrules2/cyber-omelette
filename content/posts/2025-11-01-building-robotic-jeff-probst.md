This past year, I found myself helping to organize a Survivor weekend, with some pretty tricky advanced robotic needs. I was pretty sure it could all be done, but had a fun technology journey to get there. This is a hard project to capture with a "do it yourself" style guide, but the process and outcome can hopefully aide others building similar projects! See the following video for a walk through of how JeffBot was built, and some of the lessons learned along the way.
